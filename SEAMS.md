# Seams

Protocol (implementation plan `aart_implementation_plan_v1.md` §7): distinct from `AMENDMENTS.md` (which is for *changing* an already-frozen interface). This file is for *new* interfaces being published early during Wave 1 — the moment a session defines something a sibling session will consume, even in draft form, even before that session's own package is otherwise finished, it gets an entry here. Named examples from the plan: S4's `redactRecord(record, resolvedSecretRefs)` signature (published early per S4's own DoD note); S1's `getDueWaits(now)` export for S2's ticker to call.

Consuming sessions check this file **before** proposing a shape themselves — "check `SEAMS.md`, then S0's frozen `@aart/types`/`@aart/expr`/`@aart/store`, then ask" is the intended order, never "propose and hope it converges."

Scaffolded empty by S0 (Wave 0 "Foundation") alongside `AMENDMENTS.md`. S0's own output is the frozen baseline every Wave-1 session starts from (`@aart/types`, `@aart/expr`, `@aart/store`'s interface — tagged `interfaces-frozen-v0`) — that baseline doesn't need entries here, since it isn't a mid-Wave-1 seam between two concurrent sessions, it's the starting line. The first real entries in this file will come from Wave 1.
